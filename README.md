<h1> eatHarmony Rails Back End </h1>

<p>
Restaurant Date is the back end for an application called eatHarmony (<a> https://github.com/zamarshi/restaurant_date </a>) where users can swipe left or right on other users with the same food interests and location as them. If users like each each other, they are matched and can chat to set up a date!
